# A Pokédex with Multilanguage Support
This is a Pokédex that is currently configured for learning the German names of Pokémon I made for a friend.

Python 3 is required to run. Also, the below libraries must be installed:  
pandas  
pypokedex  
pillow  
tkinter  
urllib3  

to install the above libraries, open command line and type the following for each:  
pip install library-name

What I've learned so far:  
Connecting to API via pypokedex library  
Attaching additional data to API results via PDF with German names  
Adding multilanguage support to a program
